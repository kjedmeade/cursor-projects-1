## PRD generated by ChatGPT using this prompt:

### PROMPT
"I want to creat a NextJs project where users can upload and browse recipes. This will be a recipe sharing platform. Can you create a PRD for me that has the core features, tech stack, and a step by step implementation guide. I want to use Supabase for my database / authentication backend

### PRD
The text you've provided is a very detailed and well-structured Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a recipe-sharing platform. However, the request at the end—"Please only update the homepage UI for now... and then after this we can begin implementing supabase"—seems to contradict the rest of the document.

To avoid any confusion and provide you with a clear, actionable response, I'll format the complete PRD you've provided into a more polished document. This will give you a professional, easy-to-read reference for your entire project.

If you would prefer to start with just a plan for the homepage UI, please let me know, and I can create a separate document for that.

Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Title: Recipe Sharing Platform

1. Overview
The Recipe Sharing Platform is a web application designed to empower users to share, discover, and interact with recipes. The platform will allow users to upload their own recipes, browse a collection of recipes from others, and engage through comments and ratings. The backend will be powered by Supabase for robust authentication and database management, with the frontend built using Next.js for a modern, high-performance user experience.

2. Core Features
User Authentication & Profiles
Sign Up: Users can create an account using their email and a password or through OAuth with Google or GitHub.

Login: Secure login will be managed with JWT or session-based authentication.

Profile Management: Users can update their profile information, including their username, profile picture, and a short bio.

Password Reset: A secure process for users to reset their password via email.

Recipe Management
Create Recipe: A user-friendly form for submitting new recipes, including the title, description, ingredients, steps, images, and relevant tags (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).

Edit Recipe: Users can modify their own previously uploaded recipes.

Delete Recipe: Users have the ability to remove their recipes from the platform.

Recipe List: A browsable list of all recipes with pagination for easy navigation.

Recipe Detail: A dedicated page for each recipe, displaying detailed information, instructions, and a comment section.

Search & Filtering
Search: A search bar will allow users to find recipes by title, ingredients, or tags.

Filters: Users can filter the recipe list based on predefined tags (e.g., vegetarian, low-carb).

Comments & Ratings
Comments: Users can post and view comments on any recipe.

Ratings: Users can rate recipes on a 1-5 star scale.

Admin Panel (Optional)
Content Management: Admin users can view, manage, and delete all recipes and user accounts.

Moderation: Admins can remove inappropriate content to maintain a safe community.

Recipe Sharing
Social Media: Users can easily share recipes on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

URL Sharing: Each recipe will have a unique, shareable URL.

Responsive Design
The entire platform will have a fully responsive design, optimized for seamless viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. Tech Stack
Frontend
Framework: Next.js for a React-based frontend with server-side rendering.

UI Library: React for building reusable UI components.

Styling: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling.

Image Optimization: The native next/image component will be used for efficient image loading.

Backend
Database & Services: Supabase will be used for its managed Postgres database, user authentication, and file storage.

Authentication: Supabase Auth for handling secure user sign-ups, logins, and authorization.

File Storage: Supabase Storage for storing recipe images and other user-uploaded assets.

Additional Tools/Technologies
Hosting: Vercel for deploying the Next.js application.

Advanced Image Management (Optional): Cloudinary could be integrated for more advanced image manipulation and optimization.

Security: JWT or Supabase Sessions will secure user authentication.

5. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
Project Setup: Initialize the Next.js project, install necessary dependencies (tailwindcss, @supabase/supabase-js), and configure Supabase by creating a project and adding environment variables.

User Authentication: Create a React context for managing user sessions, and build the signup, login, and profile management pages using Supabase Auth methods.

Recipe CRUD: Set up the recipes, comments, and ratings tables in Supabase. Create API routes for managing recipes, a form for user submissions (including image uploads), and pages for displaying a list of recipes and individual recipe details.

Comments & Ratings: Implement the front-end components and API routes to allow users to add comments and rate recipes.

Search & Filters: Develop the functionality to search by title/ingredients and filter recipes by tags.

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS to design a responsive and visually appealing interface for all pages.

Deployment: Deploy the application to Vercel, ensuring that Supabase environment variables are securely configured.

6. Testing & Quality Assurance
Authentication: Verify that sign-up, login, and password reset workflows are secure and functional.

Recipe Functionality: Test the complete CRUD flow for recipes—creating, editing, and deleting them.

Interactivity: Confirm that comments and ratings are correctly submitted, displayed, and stored.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure the platform works as expected on all major web browsers.

Responsiveness: Verify that the UI adapts correctly to different screen sizes.

7. Post-Launch Considerations
Analytics: Integrate a tool like Google Analytics to track user behavior and engagement.

SEO: Implement Next.js's built-in features for SEO optimization to improve search engine visibility.

User Feedback: Establish a process to collect and act on user feedback for future feature iterations (e.g., video support, personalized recipe recommendations).
